Kuberntes uses various types of objects.

1 Pod:  This is a layer of abstraction on top of a container. This is the smallest object that kubernetes can work on. In the pod, we have the container. kubectl commands will work on the pod and pod communicates there instructions to the container.

2. Service Object: This is used for port mapping and network load balancing.

3. NameSpace: This is used for creating partitions in the cluster. Pods running in  a namespace cannot communicate with other pods running in other namespace.

4. Secrets: This is used for passing encrypted data to the pods.

5. ReplicaSet / Replication COntroller: This is used for managing multiple replicas of a pod to perform activities like load balancing and autoscaling.

6. Deployment: This is used for performing all activites that a ReplicaSet can do. It can also handle rollling updates.

Create Cluster.
Open cloud shell terminal.

Command to create a pod
-----------------------------

kubectl run --image tomcat   webserver
( Webserver is pod name )

To see list of pods
------------------------
kubectl get pods

If we do not specify replicas, it creates only one replica.

To delete the pod
--------------------
kubectl delete pods webserver


Lets create pod again
-----------------------
kubectl run --image tomcat webserver

To know on which node, this pod is running




kubectl get pods -o wide
( o - stands for output )

-------------------------
But, Kubernetes performs container orchestration by using definition files. Definition files are yml files 

Definition file, will have 4 top level elements

1. apiVersion:
2. kind:
3. metadata:
4. spec: 



apiVersion:
---------------
Depending on kubernetes object we want to create, there is corresponding code library we want to use.

apiVersion referes to code library

Kind     			apiVersion
========================
Pod       			v1
Service   			v1
NameSpace     		v1
Secrets         		v1
RepliaSet       		apps/v1
Deployment      		apps/v1





kind:
----------
Refers to kubernetes object which we want to create.
Ex: Pod, Replicaset, service etc

metadata:
-----------
Additional information about the kubernets object
like name, labels  etc

spec:
------
Contains docker container related information like image name, environment variables, port mapping etc.


+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Connect to cluster by using cloud shell.

$ mkdir demofiles
$ cd demofiles




Ex1:  Create a pod definition file to start nginx in a pod. 
Name the pod as nginx-pod, name the container as appserver. 




vim pod-definition1.yml

---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
 name: nginx-pod
 labels:
  author: sunil
  type: reverse-proxy
spec:
 containers: 
  - name: appserver
    image: nginx

:wq






Command to run the definition file
------------------------------------------
kubectl create -f pod-definition1.yml


Pod is created.






To get the list of pods
---------------------------
kubectl get pods


To get the list of pods along with IP address  and which node the pod is running
---------------------------
kubectl get pods -o wide  


To delete the pod created from the above file
---------------------
kubectl delete -f  pod-definition1.yml

ReplicationController:
This is an high level object used for handling multiple replicas of a specific pod. Here we can perform load balancing and scalling.

ReplicationController uses keys like replicas, template" etc in the "spec" section.

In template section we can give metadata related to the pod and also use another spec section where we can give containers information.

Ex: Create  a replication controller for creating 3 replicas of httpd



vim  replication-controller.yml


---
apiVersion: v1
kind: ReplicationController
metadata:
 name: httpd-rc
 labels:
  author: sunil
spec:
 replicas: 3
 template:
  metadata:
   name: httpd-pod
   labels:
    author: sunil
  spec:
   containers:
    - name: myhttpd
      image: httpd
      ports:
       - containerPort: 80
         hostPort: 8080


:wq


kubectl delete --all pods   ( To delete all the existing pods )

kubectl  get pods  ( No pods available )

Open the port
-------------------
gcloud compute firewall-rules create rule21 --allow tcp:8080

kubectl create -f replication-controller.yml

kubectl  get pods  ( We should get 3 pods )

kubectl  get pods -o wide ( Observation , 3 pods are distributed in 3 nodes )

kubectl  get nodes -o wide


Take external IP ( Public IP )  of any node
34.122.234.70:8080

34.134.16.68:8080



To delete the replicas
kubectl delete -f replication-controller.yml


++++++++++++++++++++++++++
ReplicaSet
---------------

Pod is the smallest kubernetes object, which we worked on.
Next Level is replication controller.
ReplicaSet is similar to replication controller.
In replicatSet, we have an additional field in spec section called as "selector" field.

This selector uses a child element called "matchLabels"   , where it will search for pods based on a 
specific label name, and adds them to the cluster.

Ex: Create a replicaset file to start 4 tomcat replicas and then perform scaling  

vim replica-set.yml



---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: ReplicaSet
metadata:
 name: tomcat-rs
 labels:
  type: webserver
  author: sunil
spec:
 replicas: 4
 selector:
  matchLabels:
   type: webserver
 template:
  metadata:
   name: tomcat-pod
   labels:
    type: webserver
  spec:
   containers:
    - name: mywebserver
      image: tomcat
      ports:
       - containerPort: 8080
         hostPort: 9090

 
:wq


kubectl create -f replica-set.yml


kubectl  get pods  ( We should get 4 pods )

kubectl  get replicaset

Lets perform scaling from 4 pods to 6 pods

Option 1: We can open the definition file and make changes in the code from 4 to 6 in replicas field.

vim replica-set.yml

Now, we should not use create commands, we should use replace command.

kubectl replace -f replica-set.yml

kubectl  get pods  ( We should get 6 pods )

Option 2: 

kubectl scale --replicas=2 -f replica-set.yml

kubectl  get pods  ( We should get 2 pods )

Ex 2:
---------
vim pod-definition2.yml

---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
 name: postgres-pod
 labels:
  author: sunil
  type: database
spec:
 containers:
  - name: mypostgres
    image: postgres
    env:
     - name: POSTGRES_PASSWORD
       value: durgasoft
     - name: POSTGRES_USER
       value: myuser
     - name: POSTGRES_DB
       value: mydb

:wq

      
Command to run the definition file
------------------------------------------
kubectl create -f pod-definition2.yml


To get the list of pods
---------------------------
kubectl get pods


To get the list of pods along with IP address  and which node the pod is running
---------------------------
kubectl get pods -o wide


TO get more details about the pod
-----------------------------------------
kubectl describe pods  postgres-pod

or

kubectl describe pods  postgres-pod | less


Ex3:  

vim pod-definition3.yml

---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
 name: jenkins-pod
 labels:
  author: sunil
  ci: cd
spec:
 containers:
  - name: myjenkins
    image: jenkins/jenkins
    ports:
     - containerPort: 8080
       hostPort: 8080

:wq




How to open the port?
-----------------------------
gcloud compute firewall-rules create rule35 --allow tcp:8080 


gcloud compute firewall-rules create rule2 --allow tcp:9090


kubectl create -f pod-definition3.yml

kubectl get pods -o wide

Take a note on the node in which the pod is running.


gke-cluster-1-default-pool-9fb99245-q1nm


TO get the list of nodes
-----------------------
kubectl get nodes -o wide

Take the external IP of the node

35.223.183.189:8080
34.68.242.87:8080


Open browser  ( chrome)

35.223.183.189:8080   ( we should get the jenkins page )

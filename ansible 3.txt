Git Modules
------------
This is used to perform git version controlling on the managed nodes.

ansible all -m  git  -a  'repo=https://github.com/sunildevops77/repo1.git  dest=/tmp/mygit'  -b

The above command will download the files in all managed nodes.

Go to managed node and check
$  ssh 172.31.35.79
$ cd /tmp
$  ls
$ cd mygit
$  ls
$ exit


Notes:
Ansible command to clone remote git repository into all managed nodes
ansible all -m  git  -a  'repo=https://github.com/sunildevops77/rep1.git  dest=/tmp/mygit' -b

Service Module
---------------------
This is used for starting/ stoping / restarting the services.

Ansible command to restart tomcat8  on all managed nodes
$  ansible all   -m service    -a 'name=tomcat8  state=restarted'  -b

state=restarted is for restarting a service
state=stopped  is for stopping a running service
state=started  is for starting a stopped service


Replace module
-----------------
Go to managed node
$ ssh 172.31.36.52
$ cd /etc/tomcat9/
$ ls
$ sudo  vim  server.xml
 
Look for connector  port  , to see the port number in which it is running. ( line 74)

Now, we want to change the port number on all managed nodes, in this scenario
we use replace module.

Quit the server.xml file

$ exit   ( to come back to controller )
$  ansible all  -m replace  -a 'regexp=8080 replace=9090 path=/etc/tomcat9/server.xml'  -b

Lets check tomcat is respoding on 9090 port in managed node

Get public DNS from aws
ec2-13-251-114-207.ap-southeast-1.compute.amazonaws.com
ec2-13-234-48-168.ap-south-1.compute.amazonaws.com

Open Browser
URL ---  ec2-13-251-114-207.ap-southeast-1.compute.amazonaws.com:9090

We will not get the page, becuase we need to restart the service 

$  ansible all   -m service    -a 'name=tomcat9  state=restarted'  -b

Now, try the above URL  ---  it Works!!

replace module
--------------
This is used for replacing a specific string with other string.
Ex:
Ansible command to change the port number of tomcat from 8080 to 9090
$ ansible all  -m replace  -a 'regexp=8080 replace=9090 path=/etc/tomcat8/server.xml'  -b
